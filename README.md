# FNLP-2018
Foundations of Natural Language Processing 2018 - University of Edinburgh

The two assignments were in Python, using the natural language tool kit (nltk):

* Assignment 1: Corpora and Language Identification
* Assignment 2: Hidden Markov Models: Part-of-speech Tagging

The courseworks focused mainly on implementing the leading ideas and methods needed for core natural language technologies and applications, such as syntactic parsing. It involved working with both linguistic facts and issues and computational models and algorithms.
